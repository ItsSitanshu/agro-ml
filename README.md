<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
  Agriculture in resource-constrained regions faces significant challenges due to the lack of affordable and accessible diagnostic tools. Our project, Agro-ml, aims to address these issues by providing Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) services tailored for small-scale farmers in impoverished areas.
</p>

### Features:
1. **Leaf Disease Detection:**
   - Predicting disease in plants by passing leaf images through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
   - Supported plants: corn, rice, tomato, apple, leaf, potato.

2. **Market Price Predictor:**
   - Predicting prices of crops and vegetables by analyzing market trends.

3. **Fertilizer Manager:**
   - Predicting suitable fertilizers to be used by analyzing crop combinations and other environmental conditions.


<h3>Datasets</h3>

- Tarkari Price Kalimati Dataset
- Fertilizer Prediction
- Various leaf disease datasets:
  - Corn or Maize Leaf Disease
  - Rice Leaf Disease
  - Tomato Leaf Disease Detection
  - Apple Leaf Diseases
  - Potato Leaf Disease
- Assessing the Impact of Fertilizer on Crop Yield
